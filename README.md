Database Integration 🗄️

AMS is integrated with a database named "AMS". To set up the database:

Create a MySQL database instance named "AMS".
Import the database schema from database_schema.sql located in the resources/ directory.
Login Credentials 🔑

To access the application, you'll need valid login credentials. The username_password.txt file contains the usernames and corresponding hashed passwords required for logging in. Please refer to the file for the list of available usernames and passwords.

Rapport (Report) 📊

We have also included a comprehensive report (rapport.pdf) created with Photoshop that provides insights into the design choices, user experience considerations, and features of AMS. You can find the rapport in the resources/ directory.
